# Invisibility Cloak with OpenCV

This project aims to recreate the iconic invisibility cloak from the Harry Potter series in the real world using the power of computer vision. By leveraging OpenCV and background subtraction techniques, this project enables users to experience the magic of invisibility by making objects disappear from view in real-time.

## Features

- **Background Subtraction:** The project utilizes background subtraction techniques to identify and isolate the foreground object (e.g., a person holding a cloak) from the background in real-time video streams.
- **Invisibility Effect:** Once the foreground object is detected, it is masked out from the video stream, creating the illusion of invisibility similar to the cloak in Harry Potter.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** The invisibility effect can be experienced in real-time through the webcam feed, allowing users to see themselves or other objects disappear and reappear seamlessly.
- **Modular Code:** The codebase is modular and easy to understand, enabling users to customize and extend the functionality as needed.

## Usage

To test the invisibility cloak effect:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have OpenCV installed on your system.
3. Run the `main.py` script to start the application.
4. Stand in front of your webcam and hold up a cloak or similarly colored object to experience the invisibility effect in real-time.
